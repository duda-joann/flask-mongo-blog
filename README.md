# flask-mongo-blog
Flask, MongoDB, Pytest, Flask_Restful 

Blog created with Flask,  MongoDb ( using mongoengine library to connect with database), 
tests with Pytest, and api with Flask_Restful. Still in progress. 

Need  to fix: 
1) Connection with database 
2) Solve some bugs that can not  be found without connection with database
